OpenRA mod that allows only Allies and Soviets to be played in skirmish/multiplayer.

This repository contains the development of RA Simple mod, which is a sub-mod that depends on the Red Alert mod of the [OpenRA](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA) engine.

The mod is being developed here with infrequent updates.

The OpenRA engine and SDK scripts are made available under the [GPLv3](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/bleed/COPYING) license, and any executable code developed by a mod and loaded by the engine (i.e. custom mod DLLs, lua scripts) must be released under a compatible license.  Your mod data files (artwork, sound files, yaml, etc) are not part of your mod's source code, so your are free to distribute these assets under different terms (e.g. allowing redistribution in unmodified form, but not for use in other works).
